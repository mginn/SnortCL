2014-03-18 - Snort 2.9.6.1
[*] Improvements
* Added a control command to dump all packets matching a BPF to a pcap file
  for capturing specific traffic for further analysis.

* Address issue for encoded packets and icmp header length determination.

* Provide more detailed error output for parsing of invalid rules when
  byte_test, byte_check, content, and isdataat use a byte_extract value.

* Updated sensitive data to better address partial matches between packets.

2014-01-16 - Snort 2.9.6.0
[*] New additions
* Add support to do file specific processing within DCERPC preprocessor for
  files being transferred over SMB.

* File capture and storage -- saves files as they traverse the network via a
  new preprocessor that ties in support within HTTP, FTP, SMTP, POP, IMAP,
  and SMB.  See README.file and README.file_server (under tools/file_server)
  for details.

* Add <= and >= operators to byte_test rule option.

* Update SMTP to detect Cyrus SASL authentication attack.

* Add capability to capture a single session from start to end.

* EXPERIMENTAL: Add support to leverage file type identification in snort
  rules.  See README.file_ips for details.

[*] Improvements
* Only inject active responses when a TCP session is established.

* Update the POP and IMAP protocols to support simple PAF for improved
  identification and capture of files.

* Update SMTP, POP, IMAP to improve inspection when mime boundaries are
  split across packets.

* Address issue to address end of line incorrectly for Quoted Printable
  email attachments.

* Handle out of order SSL handshake in SMTP when STARTTLS is used and
  fix checks for SSL type only within the SSL hand shake.

* Update sensitive data preprocessor to handle a stateful search of
  patterns across multiple packets.

* Address a few issues in the Snort manual and other READMEs for flowbits
  and tunneling.

* Save off packet data for quicker debugging in case of a SIGABRT or SIGBUS.

* Fix alignment of sfxhash node for SPARC platforms.
